<h1>About me, FlameUser706</h1>
<a>So, my name is FlameUser706, or you can just call me Flame. I'm a highschooler with a passion for simple computer development. I do <i>very</i> basic software development, and I look after my friends as best I can.<br>I have some people that are <i>very</i> close to me, so I'm going to list them below ^^
    <br><br><br><b>
        bobafedor</b><br>&emsp;<del>Boba is my partner, the person I care the most in my entire life about. I like to say I've devoted myself entierely to them, even though that sounds kinda cryptic. In reality, I just love them so much, that I'd do anything for them. I care about them, and I would do anything and everything I could to make them happy.</del>

        <b>DarnitGarnet997</b>
        <br>&emsp;Garnet is my best friend, no question about it. If I have questions about anything, I always like to run it by him, even if it's something he knows absolutely nothing about<sub>No regrets, love you! /p</sub>. <br></a>
